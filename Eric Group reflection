There has also been trouble with people not coming to the team meetings. Some of the meetings have been missed, however the rest of the group was told and as such it was acceptible, it was more of an issue when people were not turning up to team meeting for multiple meetings in a row with no explination and with us not being able to contact them at all.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="TextRun  BCX9 SCXO83320274" lang="X-NONE" xml:lang="X-NONE" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun  BCX9 SCXO83320274">Overall I believe that the team has done well, there have been a few bumps in the road with different team members contributing different amounts of effort into the assignment, some with lots of input, and others with much less, but overall I believe that we have put together a good team project.</span></span></p>
