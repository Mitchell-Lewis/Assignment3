My unmate career goal is to be employed as a system administration in a remote capacity. I have chronic insomnia so working any set hours is tough. So my goal is to work from home and be able to do my job at any hours i can, Whether it be day or night. To achieve this i have a few goals. Complete this bachelor of information technology course. Then get some qualifications in  CompTIA A+, and a qualification in Windows server. After this i will probably speak to some employers and see what recommendations they have. If there are any additional qualification that would boost my chances of finding a remote administration job i will take them.
