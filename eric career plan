<p><span data-contrast="auto">My Career aim is to become a financial planner. In order to become a financial planner the first requirement is to complete my studies. Once I have completed my degree I am required to participate in a professional year of study under a qualified financial planner before I am allowed to directly advice clients. And then finally I am able to start taking on clients and becoming a financial planner.</span>&nbsp;</p>
